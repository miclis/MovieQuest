      | If you&apos;re after the latest and greatest movie from Apple, we suggest you look into the 2018 model of
      | the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. The headline Touch Bar &ndash; a thin OLED display at the top of the
      | keyboard which can be used for any number of things, whether that be auto-suggesting words as you type
      | or offering Touch ID so you can log in with just your fingerprint &ndash; is of course included. It&apos;s
      | certainly retained Apple&apos;s sense of style, but it comes at a cost. This is a pricey machine, so you may
      | want to consider one of the Windows alternatives. But, if you&apos;re a steadfast Apple diehard, this is
      | definitely the best movie for you!
